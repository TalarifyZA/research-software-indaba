abstract: |
    As a newly designated professional title, research software engineers (RSEs) link the two worlds of software engineering and research science. They lack clear development and training opportunities, particularly in the realm of mentoring. In this paper, we discuss mentorship as it pertains to the unique needs of RSEs and propose ways in which organizations and institutions can support mentor/mentee relationships for RSEs
