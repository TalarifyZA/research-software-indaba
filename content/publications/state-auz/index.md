abstract: |
    Research software is a critical enabler of research, and a key driver of innovation and economic growth. The ARDC commissioned a survey in 2021 on the scale and distribution of software engineering or development capability within research organisations in Australia.

    This report analyses and contextualises the survey results against national and international studies to consider the extent to which this research software engineering capability may be meeting Australia’s research needs. The 70 survey responses included representation from:

    - 18 universities
    - 6 National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) facilities
    - 3 national and/or state eResearch bodies
    - 3 research centres; and
    - 2 Publicly Funded Research Agencies (PFRAs). About the Australian Research Data Commons.

    The Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) provides the Australian research community and industry access to nationally significant, data intensive digital research infrastructure, platforms, skills and collections of high quality data. ARDC’s strategic themes include a focus on research software, in recognition of its role as a critical enabler of research and a key driver of innovation and economic growth.
