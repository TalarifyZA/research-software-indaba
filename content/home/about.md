[Talarify](https://talarify.co.za) and the [Research Software Alliance](https://www.researchsoft.org/) (ReSA) are hosting an information and discussion session to spotlight global and local research software ecosystem developments and explore how these developments may impact and benefit local organisations and communities.

Software has become an essential constituent of research, and research software is starting to be seen as an equal partner of research data in critical international policy documents such as [UNESCO](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation) and the [OECD](https://www.oecd.org/sti/recommendation-access-to-research-data-from-public-funding.htm). However, support and recognition of the importance of research software and the people who develop and maintain it have failed to keep pace with the scale of the use of research software in research.

Participants will engage in conversation with international and local organisations and peers about
- opportunities and resources that could support research software development teams
- funding opportunities and the need for policy 
- existing local and global initiatives related to research software development
- capacity development and training initiatives
- common challenges and solutions
- and more...


There will be plenty of opportunities for discussion and sharing experiences. The meeting organisers will support the development of a concrete output from the meeting, such as a report or summary document.

__This is the first meeting of its kind on the African continent.__
