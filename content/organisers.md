[__ReSA__](https://www.researchsoft.org/) aims to advance the research software ecosystem by collaborating with decision makers and key influencers. ReSA is a fiscally sponsored project of [Code for Science & Society](https://codeforscience.org/) and led by the [ReSA Steering Committee](https://www.researchsoft.org/people/).

In 2022 ReSA co-hosted an international funders’ forum meeting that led to the development of the [__Amsterdam Declaration on Funding Research Software Sustainability__](https://zenodo.org/record/7740084#.ZDbR0NJBxhE). ReSA also convenes task groups to study matters related to research software in institutional policy and research software funding opportunities.
